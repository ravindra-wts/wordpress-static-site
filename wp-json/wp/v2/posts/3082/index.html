It was first coined in the mid-1400s. It meant \u201cbeing something in essence or effect, though not actually or in fact\u201d. Later in 1959, it was used in terms of computers, where it almost meant the same: \u201cnot physically existing but made to appear by software\u201d<\/p><p>The textbook definition of virtual reality in the 21st century states that it is a simulation of 3D images or an environment that can be interacted with in an apparently physical manner generated by a computer. To make something appear that does not exist, computers use various software to generate virtual images and environments that can be seen through VR glasses or helmets, much like regular glasses\/helmets but a lot bulkier in nature.<\/p><p>AR on the other hand means Augmented Reality. Its inception took place in the 1960s.<\/p><p>Many individuals often mix up Augmented Reality (AR) with Virtual Reality (VR), despite the fact that these technologies possess subtle distinctions. Although they share certain similarities, such as the incorporation of virtual elements, there exist notable differences between them. Primarily, AR revolves around the utilization of the real-world environment, while VR immerses users entirely in a virtual realm. In simpler terms, AR combines virtual elements with the real world.<\/p><p>You can imagine, how useful these can be to use it in the field of education.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-cf428d0 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"cf428d0\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">The Role of AR-VR in Education\n<\/h2>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-7779228 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"7779228\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>We all know how complex the topics can get when it comes to learning subjects like Geometry, Biology, Physics, etc. AR-VR can soften the blow of difficulty for students by creating simulated 3D images that can be perceived much better than 2D ones on a blackboard.
